# Frequency Supported Neural Networks

*Note*: This repository is still work in progress.

This repository contains the code for the paper [Frequency Supported Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org). 

# Paper

Preprint is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06344) and in `papers` directory.

# Code 

Code used to develop and run experiments in transferred from core repository, [dynamical-neural-networks](https://github.com/kzajac97/dynamical-neural-networks/tree/main).
This repository contains unmaintained code state used to run experiments for the paper.

# Data

Three datasets were used in the paper:
* Static Affine Benchmark
* Wiener Hammerstein Benchmark
* Silverbox Benchmark

Static Affine Benchmark can be generated using provided notebook (`notebooks/static-affine-benchmark-generation.ipynb`) 
or accessed directly from data directory (`data/static-affine-benchmark.csv`). Wiener Hammerstein Benchmark and Silverbox Benchmark
(along with many others) can be accessed from [https://www.nonlinearbenchmark.org/](www.nonlinearbenchmark.org/).
